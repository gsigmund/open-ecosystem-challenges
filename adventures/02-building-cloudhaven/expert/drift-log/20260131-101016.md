## Detected Drift

```

Note: Objects have changed outside of OpenTofu

OpenTofu detected the following changes made outside of OpenTofu since the
last "tofu apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # module.north_market.google_storage_bucket.vault has been deleted
  - resource "google_storage_bucket" "vault" {
        id                          = "cloudhaven-north-market-vault"
      - location                    = "EU" -> null
      - name                        = "cloudhaven-north-market-vault" -> null
      - url                         = "gs://cloudhaven-north-market-vault" -> null
        # (15 unchanged attributes hidden)

        # (5 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }


Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the
relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include
actions to undo or respond to these changes.

OpenTofu used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

OpenTofu will perform the following actions:
